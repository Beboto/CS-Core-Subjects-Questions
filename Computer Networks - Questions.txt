25. What are Sockets and Ports (Ephemeral ports)? (Note: Socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network and also has PORT numbers)
26. What is HTTP (Stateless Protocol - Server doesn't store any info. about Client by default) and how does it works and how HTTP uses TCP?
27. Study about the HTTP Methods - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
28. Study about the HTTP Status Codes - Informational (1xx), Success (2xx), Redirect (3xx), Client-side Error (4xx) and Server-side Error (5xx).

2. What is DNS - Sub-domain, Second Level domain and Top Level Domain?
3. What are Root DNS Servers and how does DNS works?
4. What happens when you write "google.com" ?
   - Step 1: First check in own PC (Ex: Local Cache).
   - Step 2: If not found in PC, search in Local DNS server (maybe your ISP).
   - Step 3: Then again if not found, search in Root DNS server.  
   - Step 4: If not present in Root server, search in Top level domain.
   - Step 5: Then the Top Level returns the IP Address of that server.
   - Step 6: And, then the client get's connected to that server.

5. What is the role of Transport Layer - study in depth? (Note: Transportation of data from the Network to the Application within same device, also provides abstraction to the data) 
6. Study about the role of MUX and De-MUX in Transport Layer. (Note: Transport Layer also takes care of Congestion Control)
7. Study about the Congestion Control Algorithms built in TCP.
8. What are Checksums? (Note: It is a value, often a short number or string, derived from a data set used to detect accidental errors during data transmission) 
9. What are Timers? (Note: Timers are used by the TCP to avoid excessive delay during the transmission of the Segments)
10. What are the use of Sequence Numbers during the transmission of Segments? 
11. What is UDP and study it's advantages and real-world use cases? (Note: UDP can detect if data is corrupted or not using Checksums, if yes then it can't provide any solutions)
