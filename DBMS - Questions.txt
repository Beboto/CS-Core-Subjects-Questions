Part - 2:

1. Study all SQL Commands.

5. What are Anomalies - Insertion, Deletion and Updation/Modification?
6. What is Normalisation and it's types - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF? 
7. What is Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?
8. What are the advantages of Normalisation?
9. What is Transaction and what are the Transaction States?
10. What are ACID Properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Insolation and Durability?
11. What are the Recovery Mechanisms to implement Atomicity and Durability - Shadow Copy Scheme and Log-Based Recovery Methods (Deferred and Immediate DB Modifications)?
12. What is Indexing in DBMS?
13. What does an Index File contains - Search Key (Key) and Data Reference (value)?
14. What are the types of Indexing - Primary (Clustering and Sorted) Indexing and Secondary Indexing (Non-Clustering and Not-Sorted?
15. What is Sparse Index (Applied when Index File sorted based on PK/CK Attribute) and Dense Index (Applied when Index File sorted based on Non-key Attribute - Ex: Group By Dept.)?
16. What is Multi-Level Indexing?
17. What are NoSQL Databases and what are it's advantages and disadvantages?
18. Study about the Data Modelling in SQL vs NoSQL Databases.
19. What is the difference between Vertical (Scale-Up) and Horizontal (Scale-Out) Scaling?
20. Why is Horizontal Scaling not a practical option in SQL Databases? (It is very slow and costly, due to the application of Joins on different Tables)
21. When to use NoSQL Databases and what are the misconceptions of NoSQL?
22. What are the types of NoSQL Data Models - Key-Value, Column Oriented (C-Stores) , Object Oriented, Document Based and Graph Based?
23. What is the differnece between SQL and NoSQL databases?
24. What is Data Access Object Pattern (DAO)?
25. What are the types of Databases - Relational Databases, Object Oriented Databases, NoSQL Databases, Hierarchical Databases and Network Databases?
26. What is Clustering in DBMS and what are it's advanatges - Data Redundency, Load Balancing and High Availability?
27. How does Clustering Work and what is CDN?
28. What is Partitioning (Scale-Out Technique) and what are the types of Partitioning - Horizontal and Vertical?
29. When Partioning is Applied and what are it's advantages?
30. What is Sharding and what are the types of Sharding - Horizontal and Vertical?
31. What is the use of Routing Layer in Sharding?
32. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Sharding?
33. What are Distributed Databases?
34. What is CAP Theorem - Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance?
35. What are the CAP Theorem NoSQL Databases - CA, CP and AP Databases?
36. Study about ACID Properties (Banking System) and BASE Properties (Social Networking System).
37. What are SOLID Principles?
38. Study about Master-Slave Database Architecture Concept and it's advantages. (Note: Master - Performs only Write Operations and Slave (Replica-Sets) - Performs only Read Operations) 
39. How does Replication happens in Master-Slave Database Architecture - Asynchronous (Ex: Social Media App) and Synchronous (Ex: Banking App)?
40. What happens if Slave gets the 'Update' query - Ignore or Allow and Propagate to Master?
